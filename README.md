This project demonstrates how to integrate various AI services—such as **GitHub Copilot**, **Ollama**, and **OpenRouter**—into Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central using AL interfaces.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Modular Architecture:** AI services are connected via AL interfaces, making it easy to add or swap providers.
- **Flexible Integration:** Interfaces ensure loose coupling between Business Central and external AI solutions.
- **Use Case:** Currently focused on intelligent chatbots, allowing users to interact with AI models directly within Business Central.

## 💬 Chatbot Functionality

- **Model Switching:** Users can switch between activated AI models (Copilot, Ollama, OpenRouter) directly in the PromptDialog, enabling flexible conversations and testing different model responses.
- **System Role Configuration:** The system role (e.g., assistant, expert, etc.) for each AI service can be customized in the setup, tailoring the chatbot's behavior and responses to specific business needs.

## 🛠️ AI Services Used

- **GitHub Copilot:** AI-powered code completion and developer assistance.
- **Ollama:** Local AI models for fast and privacy-friendly analysis.
- **OpenRouter:** Unified API for accessing multiple AI models and providers.

## 📦 Features
